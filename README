LostInTheWoods is a survival game made in Unity experimenting with built-in 
features such as wind, shaders, and navigation AI. The result is a First Person 
game where the player attempts to run from robots which continuously spawn and 
move towards the player using a navMesh involving a large portion of the ingame 
area.
